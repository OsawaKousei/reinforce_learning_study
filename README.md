# About
I created this repositry for study reinforce learning and share the implemented codes.
I learned RL with 『ゼロから作るDeep Learning ❹ 強化学習編』,
and reference implementation from https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch-4?tab=readme-ov-file .

The main difference from reference code are below.
- Using pytorch for implementation of neural network
- Using uv for manage environment
